# This tests test vagrant-registration plugin running on Fedora
# with libvirt. If you do not have Vagrant installed or if you
# have vagrant-libvirt package on your system, Vagrant will be
# installed or vagrant-libvirt removed respectively. In that case
# you need sudo to run the tests. If you do not run Fedora, make
# sure you have Vagrant installed (any provider should do if you
# add RHEL box called 'rhel-7').
#
# IMPORTANT: Tests need valid credentials to actually test
# registration. This can be provided in form of environment
# variables.
#
# NOTE: This will install a development version of
# vagrant-registration on your system.
